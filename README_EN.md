# Codex Agent — Let OpenClaw Operate Codex for You 🧠

**English** | [中文](README.md)

> Lie in bed, say one sentence, and OpenClaw will launch Codex, craft prompts, handle approvals, check quality, and report results. You can jump into the terminal anytime.

**This is an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)-exclusive Skill.** It requires OpenClaw as the AI agent runtime, leveraging its agent wake-up, message delivery, and cron capabilities to drive the entire workflow.

## What Is It?

In one sentence: **OpenClaw operates Codex CLI on behalf of the user.**

Codex is OpenAI's terminal coding tool. It's powerful, but requires you to sit at your computer — writing prompts, watching output, approving commands, checking results. This skill lets OpenClaw do all of that for you.

It comes down to two things: **tmux + hooks**.

- **tmux**: Codex runs in a tmux session. OpenClaw reads output and sends commands through tmux — exactly like a human would in the terminal
- **hooks**: When Codex finishes a task or waits for approval, it automatically notifies the user (Telegram) + wakes up OpenClaw to handle it

You can `tmux attach` at any time to see what Codex is doing, or even take over.

## Full-Power Codex

Normal usage: you manually write a prompt and send it to Codex. Codex only knows what you tell it.

With this skill, OpenClaw does the following **before** sending a task to Codex:

1. **Understands the goal**: Scope, acceptance criteria, project context, and constraints
2. **Chooses the execution mode**: exec for simple tasks, TUI + tmux for complex, multi-turn, or approval-heavy tasks
3. **Crafts the prompt**: Not forwarding the user's raw message, but turning the goal, context, completion criteria, and verification requirements into an executable Codex task
4. **Supervises quality**: Waits for hook wake-ups, checks the result, and asks Codex to iterate when needed

The Codex runtime is expected to be configured ahead of time by the user. OpenClaw does not maintain a static capability inventory; when models, MCP servers, skills, or permissions need to be confirmed, it should prefer live CLI output from the machine running Codex.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Normal Codex workflow:

```
Sit at computer → Open terminal → Think about prompt → Start Codex → Watch output →
Approve commands → Not satisfied? Start over → Done
```

With this skill:

```
Lie in bed → Tell OpenClaw in Telegram "Add XX feature to this project" →
OpenClaw starts Codex → Handles everything in between → Notifies you on Telegram when done →
Not satisfied? Say one sentence to continue → Want to watch? tmux attach for live view
```

**Core value: The user sets the goal, OpenClaw manages the process, and Codex does the execution.**

## Workflow

```
1. User gives task (Telegram / terminal / any channel)
     ↓
2. OpenClaw understands requirements, asks clarifying questions
     ↓
3. OpenClaw designs prompt, selects execution mode, confirms with user
     ↓
4. OpenClaw launches Codex in tmux
     ↓
5. Codex works, OpenClaw gets woken up via hooks:
   ├── Task complete → OpenClaw checks output quality
   │   ├── Satisfied → Notifies user on Telegram with results
   │   └── Not satisfied → Tells Codex to keep working
   ├── Waiting for approval → OpenClaw decides approve/reject
   └── Directional issue → Immediately asks user for confirmation
     ↓
6. User receives final result
   (can tmux attach at any point during the process)
```

OpenClaw handles the entire process autonomously, but **every step is simultaneously sent to Telegram** — task completion, approval requests, output content — all visible on your phone in real time. You can choose to ignore it (let OpenClaw handle it) or jump in and intervene at any time.

## How It Works: tmux + hooks

### tmux: Operating the Terminal Like a Human

OpenClaw operates Codex exactly like a human would:

```bash
# Start Codex (same as typing in terminal)
tmux send-keys -t codex-session 'codex --full-auto' Enter

# Send prompt (same as typing)
tmux send-keys -t codex-session 'Implement XX feature'
sleep 1
tmux send-keys -t codex-session Enter

# Check output (same as looking at the screen)
tmux capture-pane -t codex-session -p
```

Benefits of tmux:
- **Not limited by OpenClaw turn timeout**: Codex can run as long as needed; OpenClaw checks in when woken up
- **User can join anytime**: `tmux attach -t codex-session` to see real-time output
- **Persistent**: OpenClaw restart, network disconnect — Codex keeps running

### Hooks: Automatic Notifications for Task Completion and Approval Requests

Two mechanisms cover two types of events:

**1. Codex notify hook (task completion)**

Codex's built-in `notify` config calls a script when a task is done:

```
Codex completes turn → on_complete.py
                       ├── 📱 Telegram notifies user (full Codex reply)
                       └── 🤖 Wakes OpenClaw (auto-checks output)
```

Users see Codex's complete reply on Telegram — essentially real-time monitoring.

**2. tmux pane monitor (approval requests)**

Codex's notify doesn't cover approval scenarios, so `pane_monitor.sh` monitors tmux output:

```
Codex shows approval prompt → pane_monitor.sh detects keywords
                              ├── 📱 Telegram notifies user (specific command awaiting approval)
                              └── 🤖 Wakes OpenClaw (auto-decides approve/reject)
```

Both mechanisms **trigger dual channels simultaneously**: user and OpenClaw both receive the message. User can ignore it (OpenClaw will handle it) or reply directly to intervene.

### User Can Take Over Anytime

This is not a black box. At any time:

- `tmux attach -t codex-session`: See exactly what Codex is doing
- Type directly in tmux: Take over operation
- `tmux detach`: Done watching, hand back to OpenClaw

## Two Approval Modes

User chooses before launch:

| Mode | Who Approves | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Codex auto** (`--full-auto`) | Codex decides | Routine dev, hands-off |
| **OpenClaw approves** (default) | OpenClaw decides approve/reject | Sensitive ops, need oversight |

Pane monitor runs in both modes (`--full-auto` occasionally still prompts for approval).

## Knowledge Base: On-Demand Reference

OpenClaw doesn't blindly forward commands, but standard tasks do not read the knowledge base by default. This avoids extra context and stale information. The knowledge base is used on demand for complex prompts, config changes, troubleshooting, or manual updates:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `features.md` | feature flags, slash commands, CLI subcommands |
| `config_schema.md` | Complete config.toml field definitions |
| `capabilities.md` | Historical environment capability snapshot, reference only |
| `prompting_patterns.md` | Prompt pattern library (by task type) |
| `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` | 5-tier data source update protocol |
| `changelog.md` | Version changes + findings from testing |

The knowledge base gets stale, so there's an update protocol: triggered by version change / >7 days / manual request, updating from CLI introspection → Schema → GitHub → Official docs → Community sources.

## Quick Start

See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for detailed setup (7 steps, ~5 minutes).

Or, send this message to your OpenClaw and it will auto-configure everything:

> Please install and configure the codex-agent skill.
> First read the full installation guide at `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/codex-agent/INSTALL.md`, then follow the steps to complete the setup.
> If the file doesn't exist yet, first clone from https://github.com/dztabel-happy/codex-agent to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/codex-agent/`, then read INSTALL.md and execute.

After setup, just say something to OpenClaw in Telegram:

> "Use Codex to add XX feature to /path/to/project"

## Update

Already installed? Update to the latest version:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/codex-agent
git pull
```

See **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for what's new.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) installed and running
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed
- tmux installed
- Telegram configured as OpenClaw message channel
- ⚠️ **OpenClaw session auto-reset must be disabled or extended** (default daily reset loses Codex task context, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md))

## Known Issues & Workarounds

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| OpenClaw daily session reset loses long task context | Disable auto-reset (see INSTALL.md) |
| tmux send-keys text + Enter together, Codex unresponsive | Send separately with sleep 1s in between |
| `--full-auto` conflicts with shell alias | Check `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` for codex aliases |
| Codex notify doesn't cover approval waits | pane_monitor.sh fills the gap |
| `--full-auto` occasionally still prompts | pane monitor runs in all modes |
| Codex memories don't work | `disable_response_storage = true` + custom provider incompatible |
| Notify payload missing field docs | `turn-id` and `cwd` discovered through testing |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Port pattern to Claude Code / OpenCode agent
- [ ] Add more prompt patterns (code review, architecture design)
- [ ] pane monitor: detect more approval patterns
